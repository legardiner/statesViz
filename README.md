# D3 Assignment 2 Visualization

Write a d3/javascript program that reads in the `states.csv` file and generates a scatter bubble plot with the following criteria:

* Size each state bubble by population
* Color each bubble with a diverging color map to show population growth
* Assign poverty rate to the X axis
* Assign total of property, income and sales tax to the Y axis

To run the visualization, run the following command in your terminal:

```
python -m http.server [port number]
```

Open your browser and go to `localhost:[port number]`
